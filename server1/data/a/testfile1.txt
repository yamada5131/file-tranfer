Hello everyone,

Reading this has exposed a basic gap in my knowledge of linux ownership:
https://www.archlinux.org/news/binaries â€¦ ervention/

How is it that a directory /bin can be owned by a package contained within it, as is implied by the query option "-o" to pacman in step 1 of the above linked page?:

$ pacman -Qqo /bin /sbin /usr/sbin | pacman -Qm -

Incidentally, I get no output from this command or the others in steps 1 and 3, so it seems from reading the following that there are no packages causing problems (I'm pretty sure I don't have any packages from unofficial repositories):
https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=164505

Secondly, (and I may be completely wrong here), is it really as simple as this to move all the binaries from /bin and /sbin into /usr/bin, then create symbolic links in the root directory pointing to this new location?:

cd /
rsync -a /bin/ /usr/bin/
rsync -a /sbin/ /usr/bin/
ln -s /bin /usr/bin
ln -s /sbin /usr/bin
rm -R /bin /sbin

I use rsync -a here to preserve permissions, although I've heard that I could use tar. Is there a safer/more succinct way of doing this? And finally, I delete the original directories and their
contents last. If I were to delete them AFTER copying their contents to /usr/bin but BEFORE creating the symlinks, I would be in serious trouble, wouldn't I?
